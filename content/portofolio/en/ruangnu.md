# RuangNU

An integrated digital platform designed to support Nahdlatul Ulama members with Islamic resources, community services, and educational content — bringing spiritual guidance and practical tools together in one accessible space.

## Challenge

Nahdlatul Ulama members needed a centralized digital platform for their daily religious and community needs. Most solutions are fragmented — prayer apps here, Islamic content there, forums elsewhere. Nothing brings it all together in a way that feels cohesive and purpose-built for NU's unique identity.

## Solution

We created a comprehensive Islamic platform that serves spiritual, educational, and community needs:

- **Islamic Resource Library** – Complete collection of daily prayers (doa), dzikir, tasbih guides, and shalawat
- **Prayer & Worship Tools** – Accurate prayer times, Qibla finder, Islamic calendar, Hijri converter, and Ramadan schedules
- **Digital Islamic Library** – Curated Islamic books, scholarly articles, and research papers from NU perspectives
- **Community Features** – Discussion forums, event calendar, local NU branch information, and news updates
- **Educational Content** – Accessible resources for Islamic learning and spiritual growth
- **Future Marketplace** – Planned feature for NU-affiliated products and services

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** PHP Native, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** MySQL  
**Type:** Community System

## Results

A spiritually centered platform that strengthens bonds between members, provides practical daily tools, and supports Islamic education — designed with NU traditions in mind and built for future growth.
