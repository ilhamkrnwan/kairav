## Challenge

Kamaba Yogyakarta needed a digital system beyond a simple profile website—one that could manage member and board data, provide real-time event and news updates, and allow admins to manage content easily without technical skills.

## Solution

We built an integrated information system that serves as the official hub for members and the public, featuring:

- **Authentication & User Management** – Member registration, login, and role-based access control
- **Membership Management** – Centralized member database with activation controls
- **Organization Structure** – Visual org chart with position and board history
- **Events & Activities** – Event calendar, registration, and documentation
- **News & Content** – Dynamic CMS for publishing articles and updates
- **Gallery** – Responsive photo albums with lightbox preview
- **Admin Dashboard** – Statistics, quick actions, and data management

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Nuxt 4, Nuxt UI v4, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** MySQL, REST API, RBAC

## Results

A scalable, modern platform with integrated data management, responsive design, and robust security—ready to grow with the organization's future needs.
