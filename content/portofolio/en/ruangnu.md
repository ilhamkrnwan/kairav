## The Need

Nahdlatul Ulama members needed a centralized digital platform that truly serves their daily religious and community needs. Most existing solutions are fragmented — prayer apps here, Islamic content there, community forums somewhere else. Nothing brings it all together in a way that feels cohesive and purpose-built for NU's unique identity.

The platform needed to:
- Provide **comprehensive Islamic resources** in one place
- Include **practical daily tools** like prayer times and Qibla direction
- Foster **community connection** through forums and events
- Support **Islamic education** with accessible content
- Eventually include a **marketplace** for NU-affiliated initiatives
