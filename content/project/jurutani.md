## Overview

**Jurutani** is a digital agriculture platform that I developed using **Nuxt 3** and **CapacitorJS**. It enables users to remotely monitor and control their agricultural land. The platform also includes an AI chatbot that provides guidance, answers frequently asked questions, and helps with troubleshooting.
