# RuangNU

An integrated digital platform supporting Nahdlatul Ulama members with Islamic resources, community services, and educational content.

## Challenge

NU members needed a centralized platform for daily religious and community needs. Existing solutions are fragmented across different apps and websites.

## Solution

- **Islamic Resource Library** – Complete collection of daily prayers, dzikir, tasbih, and shalawat
- **Prayer & Worship Tools** – Accurate prayer times, Qibla finder, Islamic calendar, and Hijri converter
- **Digital Islamic Library** – Curated books, scholarly articles, and research papers from NU perspectives
- **Community Features** – Discussion forums, event calendar, and local NU branch information
- **Educational Content** – Accessible resources for Islamic learning
- **Future Marketplace** – Planned feature for NU-affiliated products and donation management

## Results

A spiritually centered platform that strengthens bonds between members, provides practical daily tools, and supports Islamic education.
