## Introduction

Vue 3 and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building modern, robust, and scalable web applications. This guide will walk you through the key concepts and best practices for using them together.

### Why Vue 3?

Vue 3 introduces the Composition API, which provides a more flexible and organized way to structure your code. It also offers better performance and improved TypeScript support out of the box.

### The Role of TypeScript

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development, improves code readability, and provides excellent autocompletion in your editor.

## Setting Up Your Project

Start by creating a new Vue project with TypeScript support using the official command-line tool:

```bash
npm create vue@latest my-vue-app -- --ts
```

This will scaffold a new project with all the necessary configurations.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Vue 3 and TypeScript, you can build high-quality web applications with confidence. The combination of a progressive framework and a typed language leads to a more efficient and enjoyable development experience.
