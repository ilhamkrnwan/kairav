## Overview

**RuangNU** is an internal digital platform developed to support the daily religious, educational, and community needs of Nahdlatul Ulama members. The platform centralizes various Islamic resources, including prayers, dhikr, shalawat, and an Islamic calendar, alongside practical tools such as prayer schedules and Qibla direction.

Built using **PHP Native**, **MySQL**, and **Tailwind CSS**, RuangNU prioritizes simplicity, performance, and accessibility. In addition to religious content, the platform is designed to grow into a broader ecosystem that includes educational materials, a community forum, event listings, and a marketplace for NU-affiliated initiatives.

At its current stage, RuangNU remains **unpublished** and is under active development, serving as a foundation for future expansion and refinement.
