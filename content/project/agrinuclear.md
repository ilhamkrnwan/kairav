## Overview

**Agrinuclear** is a specialized educational website that I developed for the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). The platform focuses on the application of nuclear science in agriculture, particularly in the field of plant mutation breeding. It serves as a central hub for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to access reliable information, learn from interactive modules, and engage with a community of experts. The project was built using **Laravel** and **MySQL**.
