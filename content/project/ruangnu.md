## Overview

**RuangNU** is a comprehensive mobile application that I developed for the Nahdlatul Ulama community. The app provides a wide range of features, including access to religious content like prayers and shalawat, utility tools like a Qibla finder and prayer schedules, an educational library, and a community marketplace. Built with **Nuxt 3** and **Firebase**, RuangNU aims to be an indispensable digital companion for NU members.
