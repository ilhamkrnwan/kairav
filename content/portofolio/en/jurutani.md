## The Problem

Indonesian farmers face real challenges: unpredictable weather, fluctuating market prices, limited access to expert advice, and outdated farming techniques. Most digital solutions are either too complicated, too expensive, or just don't understand what farmers actually need in their day-to-day work.

We needed a platform that:
- Delivers **real-time, actionable data** that farmers can use immediately
- Connects farmers with **experts and each other** for knowledge sharing
- Provides **practical tools** for crop management and decision-making
- Works seamlessly on mobile devices, even with limited connectivity
- Includes a marketplace to help farmers sell directly and buy supplies
