## Challenge

Nuclear agriculture sounds intimidating. Students, educators, and curious minds want to learn about how nuclear technology creates better crops and sustainable farming solutions, but most resources are either too academic or too vague. We needed a platform that makes complex scientific concepts actually understandable while staying lightweight and fast.

## Solution

We created an educational platform that transforms dense academic research into clear, engaging content:

- **Visual-First Learning** – Infographics, diagrams, and visual guides that make complex processes easy to grasp
- **Educational Articles** – Deep dives into mutation breeding, radiation applications, and nuclear agriculture techniques in plain language
- **Structured Content** – Information organized by difficulty level and topic for self-paced or classroom learning
- **Academic References** – Properly cited sources and research links for deeper exploration
- **Responsive Design** – Clean interface that works seamlessly on any device

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
**Type:** Static Site

## Results

Made advanced agricultural science approachable for students, educators, and the public. Transformed dry scientific content into an engaging learning journey with fast loading and smooth navigation.
